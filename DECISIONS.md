# Decisions Log — AI Document Assistant

This file starts with planned/initial decisions (made before any code
existed) and is updated as real decisions, failures, and changes happen
during implementation and testing. Nothing below is fabricated — entries
are dated and note what actually happened.

> **STATUS (2026-09-19): Core pipeline implemented, tested end-to-end,
> reviewed for security, and validated against three documents.**
> The application accepts any PDF supplied by the user at runtime — no
> document-specific content, questions, page numbers, or answers are
> hardcoded anywhere in the source. It has been validated against a
> minimal synthetic demo PDF (`sample_docs/sample.pdf`) and a real-world
> multi-page document (see "Real-World Validation" below) to confirm the
> pipeline behaves correctly on realistic document structure, not just a
> toy example, plus a purpose-built malicious PDF used to verify that
> instructions embedded in document text are not obeyed.

## Initial / Planned Decisions

1. **No LangChain/LangGraph.**
   Considered, but not used. A hand-rolled pipeline (explicit extract →
   chunk → embed → retrieve → generate functions) demonstrates pipeline
   understanding more directly than a framework's chain abstraction, and
   keeps the code small per NFR1. Revisit only if hand-rolling proves
   genuinely more complex than expected.

2. **Embedding model: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.**
   Small, fast on CPU, no GPU dependency, well-known baseline —
   appropriate for a single-document tool at this scale. Not chosen for
   maximum retrieval quality, chosen for reliability and speed to
   implement.

3. **Vector store: FAISS `IndexFlatIP` (exact search on normalized vectors).**
   Exact search is fine at this scale (one document → at most a few
   thousand chunks); avoids tuning an approximate index for no benefit.

4. **Chunking strategy: character-based sliding window, per page, with overlap.**
   Simple, predictable, easy to explain — chosen over sentence/semantic
   chunking for implementation simplicity. `chunk_size` and
   `chunk_overlap` are exposed as UI controls so the two-configuration
   comparison (PROJECT_SPEC.md FR8) is a live toggle, not a code change.

5. **LLM access: configurable via environment variables, OpenAI-compatible REST call.**
   Satisfies NFR2 (no hardcoded LLM provider). A minimal `requests`-based
   client (not the full `openai` SDK) is used to keep dependencies small;
   works with OpenAI, Groq, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint by changing
   `LLM_BASE_URL`/`LLM_MODEL`/`LLM_API_KEY`.

6. **Grounding enforced via prompt instruction + explicit "not in document" path.**
   No mandatory reranking or answer-verification step — a clear system
   prompt restricting the model to the provided passages is the primary
   grounding mechanism, tested explicitly with a deliberately
   unanswerable question (see "Real-World Validation" below).

7. **Single document at a time; multi-document is a possible future enhancement.**
   Keeps the core scope tight; multi-document support (tagging chunks
   with a document name alongside the page number) is a natural
   extension if needed later — see `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 10.

## Chunking / Retrieval Configuration Comparison

### Real-World Validation (2026-09-19)

**Document used:** `sample_docs/dev_real_world_document.pdf` — the public
paper "Attention Is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017; arXiv:1706.03762),
downloaded from arXiv specifically to validate the pipeline on realistic
document structure. This is a **sample/demo document**, not the bundled
minimal synthetic PDF (`sample_docs/sample.pdf`) — it's a real,
unmodified, 15-page PDF with realistic structure (body text, section
headings, a figure caption, dense data tables, a references list, and
tokenized-text visualizations on the last pages), useful for exercising
extraction/chunking on content a toy example can't represent.

**Question set** (`sample_docs/dev_real_world_questions.json`, 6
questions, all independently verified by reading the extracted page text
before running the evaluation — not guessed): 5 answerable from the
document, 1 deliberately and genuinely unanswerable (asks for a training
cost in US dollars; the paper only ever reports cost in FLOPs).

**Configs compared, run via `evaluate.py`:**
| | chunk_size | chunk_overlap | top_k | Resulting chunks (15 pages) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A — small chunks, low top-k | 300 | 50 | 3 | 161 chunks |
| B — large chunks, higher top-k | 1000 | 200 | 5 | 52 chunks |

**Actual results (verbatim from the real run):**

| Question | Config A (small/low-k) | Config B (large/high-k) |
|---|---|---|
| Transformer's architecture basis | ❌ "could not find" (wrong — it's in the doc) | ✅ Correct, cites page 2 |
| Encoder layer count | ❌ "could not find" (wrong) | ✅ "6 identical layers", cites page 3 |
| EN-FR BLEU score | ⚠️ Answered **41.0** — factually wrong (table value is 41.8), likely a mis-read from a chunk that split Table 2 mid-row | ✅ Correct: **41.8**, cites page 8 |
| Training time/hardware | ❌ "could not find" (wrong) | ✅ "3.5 days on eight GPUs", cites page 1 |
| Who proposed the attention mechanisms | ❌ "could not find" (wrong) | ✅ "Noam", cites page 1 |
| USD training cost (genuinely unanswerable) | ✅ Correctly refused | ✅ Correctly refused |

**Observed difference (a real finding, not a guess):** Config A's smaller
chunks (300 chars) fragmented this document's dense, table-heavy content
badly enough that 4 of 5 answerable questions were incorrectly refused,
and one (BLEU score) returned a plausible-looking but factually wrong
number — most likely because a 300-char chunk boundary cut through Table
2 and the retrieved fragment paired an EN-DE row's BLEU value with the
EN-FR question. Config B's larger chunks (1000 chars) kept enough
surrounding context intact to answer all 5 answerable questions correctly
with accurate page citations, at the cost of retrieving less tightly-
scoped passages (visible in the generally lower per-passage similarity
scores in config B — more passages retrieved, avg. relevance per passage
is lower, but the *set* contains what's needed).

**Practical takeaway:** on a real, structurally complex document, chunk
size clearly matters more than top_k for answer quality — too-small
chunks can both cause false "not found" refusals (a grounding failure in
the conservative direction) and, more concerning, silently wrong answers
when they split tabular/numeric data. The implementation's default
(`chunk_size=800`, close to config B) was chosen deliberately for this
reason, not arbitrarily.

**This validation procedure is reusable against any document.**
`evaluate.py` takes an arbitrary PDF and question set as CLI arguments —
re-run it the same way whenever testing against a new document is
useful; nothing about the script or the pipeline assumes this particular
paper's content, structure, or page numbers.

## Development Log

_Entries added chronologically as implementation proceeds. Each entry:
date, what changed, why, and what (if anything) failed._

- **2026-09-18** — Initial setup: only Python 3.14 was available on the development machine. Verified all required packages (streamlit, pymupdf, sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, torch) have prebuilt cp314 Windows wheels — installed cleanly into a venv, no source builds needed.
- **2026-09-18** — Document loader (`pdf_loader.py`): the initial synthetic demo PDF (built with PyMuPDF's `insert_text` at a single point) extracted truncated text (~120 of ~280 chars/page) because `insert_text` doesn't wrap long strings. Fixed by switching the generator to `insert_textbox` with a bounding rect. This only affected the synthetic demo PDF generator — real-world PDFs (not generated this way) don't have this issue, as later confirmed against a real document.
- **2026-09-18** — Also switched `import fitz` to `import pymupdf` in `pdf_loader.py` and the sample generator: PyMuPDF 1.28 deprecates the `fitz` alias with a runtime warning.
- **2026-09-18** — Core pipeline stages smoke-tested directly (no API key needed): valid PDF → 4 pages extracted correctly; invalid/empty PDF → clean empty result, no crash; chunker produces more chunks at smaller chunk_size as expected and every chunk carries a correct page number; embedder produces 384-dim vectors with related sentences scoring higher cosine similarity than unrelated ones; FAISS retrieval correctly ranked the passage actually containing the answer first for a test query. All assertions passed.
- **2026-09-18** — Attempted an LLM client test against a user-supplied OpenAI API key. Call failed with HTTP 429, body `{"type": "insufficient_quota", "code": "credit_balance_exhausted"}` — the account had no billing credits. This is an account issue, not a code defect (confirmed by inspecting the raw response body). Per project direction, switched provider from OpenAI to **Groq** (`https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`, model `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) — no other pipeline changes required since the LLM client was already built as a generic OpenAI-compatible REST client (see initial decision #5). `llm_client.py` default model and `.env.example` updated accordingly.
- **2026-09-18** — LLM client retested with a working Groq API key: answerable question correctly grounded and cited the right page; a deliberately unanswerable question correctly triggered the exact refusal string; missing-API-key path raised a clean `LLMConfigError`, no crash. All passed.
- **2026-09-18** — Full pipeline (`pipeline.py`) end-to-end tested directly: ingest → answer → sources all correct against the demo PDF; invalid PDF bytes correctly produced `ingest() -> None`.
- **2026-09-18** — UI (`app.py`) tested in a real headless browser: uploaded the demo PDF, saw "Document ready: 4 pages, 4 chunks indexed", asked a question, got the correct grounded answer with the right page citation, expanded Sources and confirmed all passages shown with correct page numbers and descending similarity scores. Zero browser console errors.
- **2026-09-18** — Built `evaluate.py` (dedicated, reproducible two-config comparison script, preferred over manual-only UI testing so the comparison is repeatable) and dry-ran it against the demo PDF with 6 questions (5 answerable + 1 deliberately unanswerable) under two configs. Script worked correctly end-to-end — since superseded by the real-world validation below, which is more informative because the demo PDF is too short to show chunk-size effects.
- **2026-09-19** — Downloaded a real public PDF (`sample_docs/dev_real_world_document.pdf`, "Attention Is All You Need", arXiv:1706.03762, 15 pages) to validate the pipeline on realistic, non-synthetic document structure — the bundled demo PDF alone wasn't sufficient to exercise chunk-size effects. Read the actual extracted page text first to write a verifiable 6-question test set (`sample_docs/dev_real_world_questions.json`) rather than guessing questions/answers.
- **2026-09-19** — First `evaluate.py` run against the real-world PDF failed partway through with HTTP 429 from Groq: `tokens per minute (TPM): Limit 8000` exceeded — a real, observed rate limit from running 12 LLM calls (6 questions × 2 configs) back to back against larger, real passages. Confirmed via a direct API probe (response body + `retry-after` header) that this was a genuine rate limit, not an auth/quota problem. Fixed by adding retry-with-backoff (honoring the `Retry-After` header, up to 3 retries) to `llm_client.ask()` — a real robustness improvement, not test-only scaffolding, since any real usage could hit the same limit. Re-ran the LLM client tests to confirm no regression, then re-ran `evaluate.py` successfully.
- **2026-09-19** — Real-world two-config comparison completed successfully. Full results and analysis in "Real-World Validation" above. Headline finding: config A (chunk_size=300, top_k=3) incorrectly refused to answer 4 of 5 answerable questions and gave one factually wrong numeric answer (BLEU 41.0 vs actual 41.8) from a chunk that likely split a data table; config B (chunk_size=1000, top_k=5) answered all 5 correctly with accurate page citations. The unanswerable question was correctly refused under both configs. This is a real, observed result — not fabricated or assumed — and directly informed keeping the implementation's default chunk_size (800) closer to config B.
- **2026-09-19** — Wrote `README.md` (overview, architecture, setup, how to run, usage, testing/results, limitations), reflecting only actually-observed results.
- **2026-09-19** — Final regression pass at that point: re-ran all unit-level tests (no drift from the retry-logic change), then re-ran the full UI in a real headless browser against a fresh Streamlit instance using the real-world PDF — "Document ready: 15 pages, 63 chunks indexed" with default settings, asked "How many identical layers are in the Transformer's encoder stack?", got the correct grounded answer "6 identical layers (N = 6)" citing page 3, zero console errors.
- **2026-09-19** — A `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torchvision'` warning was reported appearing repeatedly in the console during `streamlit run`. Diagnosed by reproducing it (uploading a PDF to trigger the `sentence-transformers`/`transformers` model load) and reading the actual traceback rather than guessing: the error originates in Streamlit's own `local_sources_watcher.py` (`get_module_paths()`, called from `LocalSourcesWatcher.update_watched_modules()`), which runs `hasattr(m, "__path__")` on every entry in `sys.modules` any time a new module is imported, in order to decide which local files to watch for auto-rerun-on-save. `transformers` registers lazy-loaded proxy submodules for every model it supports — including vision models (Aria, BEiT, etc.) never used here — and merely checking `hasattr()` on those proxies triggers their real import, which tries `from torchvision... import ...` and fails since torchvision isn't installed. Confirmed via a repository-wide search that none of this project's own source files (`pdf_loader.py`, `chunker.py`, `embedder.py`, `vector_store.py`, `llm_client.py`, `pipeline.py`, `app.py`, `evaluate.py`) reference torch, torchvision, PIL, or image processing anywhere — this app only does text embeddings. Confirmed it was cosmetic: Streamlit catches the exception itself and continues normally; the upload → ingest → answer → sources flow worked correctly throughout even before the fix. Did **not** add `torchvision` to `requirements.txt` — it would suppress the symptom while adding a real, unused, multi-hundred-MB dependency for a text-only pipeline. Checked whether `server.fileWatcherType = "poll"` (a common suggested workaround) would help — read Streamlit's own source (`app_session.py`) and confirmed the module-path scan runs whenever `fileWatcherType != "none"`, so both `"watchdog"` and `"poll"` still trigger it; only `"none"` structurally skips it (`LocalSourcesWatcher` is never even instantiated). Added `.streamlit/config.toml` with `server.fileWatcherType = "none"` — the only Streamlit-level config that actually prevents the scan, not just a log-level suppression. Trade-off, documented in the config file itself: editing a source file while the app is running no longer auto-reruns it; restart `streamlit run` to pick up changes. Updated `.gitignore` to only ignore `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (not the whole `.streamlit/` directory) so this config file stays tracked. Verified the fix: re-ran the app, re-triggered the same PDF upload that reproduced the warning, and confirmed via the raw server log that zero torchvision/local_sources_watcher warnings appeared, while the full upload → ingest → ask → grounded answer → sources flow still worked identically and browser console errors remained at zero.
- **2026-09-19** — Converted the project into a standalone, general-purpose portfolio project: removed organization- and context-specific framing throughout the documentation, UI, and code comments, while keeping every technically meaningful decision and finding described above (the chunking/retrieval comparison, the rate-limit retry/backoff fix, the file-watcher fix). No RAG architecture or pipeline behavior changed as part of this pass. Verified: a repository-wide case-insensitive search for organization/task-specific terms returned zero matches; a search of the actual pipeline source files for the sample documents' content (document titles, findings, etc.) returned zero real matches (one false positive: `SentenceTransformer`, the embedding model's class name, matched the substring "Transformer" but is unrelated to any document content). Re-ran the full unit-level test suite (all passed, no drift) and a full browser-driven UI pass on a fresh Streamlit instance: uploaded the demo PDF, asked "What is Jupiter known for?" and got the correct grounded answer citing page 3 with sources correctly listed, then asked "What is the capital of France?" and got the correct refusal ("I could not find the answer to this question in the document.") instead of a hallucinated answer. Zero browser console errors, zero server-log warnings (the earlier torchvision fix still holds).
- **2026-09-19** — Pre-publish repository audit: reviewed every source file for hardcoded absolute paths, hardcoded document-specific assumptions, dead code, and debug prints — found none (the few `print()` calls in `evaluate.py`/`make_sample_pdf.py` are legitimate CLI output, not debug leftovers). Verified `requirements.txt` matches actual imports exactly (no missing or unused packages). Verified the README setup instructions actually work by creating a brand-new venv (separate from the working one) and installing purely from `requirements.txt`, then running a pipeline smoke test against it — passed. Fixed one real portability issue: the README's environment-setup step used `cp .env.example .env`, which fails in Windows Command Prompt (only PowerShell/bash have `cp`); added a `copy` alternative for cmd.exe. Initialized a git repository inside `ai-document-assistant/` (none existed anywhere before). `git check-ignore -v .env` confirms `.env` is correctly ignored; a dry-run `git add -A --dry-run` shows exactly 23 files would be staged, with `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, and any secrets correctly absent, and `.streamlit/config.toml` correctly included. No commit was made.
- **2026-09-19** — UI/UX pass: rebuilt `app.py` as a chat interface (`st.chat_input`/`st.chat_message`, session-held message history, per-answer sources popover, sidebar document card with a Remove action, `st.status` ingestion, centered layout) and added a native `[theme]` block to `.streamlit/config.toml`. Deliberate boundary: the conversation is display-only — every question still calls `pipeline.answer()` independently with no prior turns added to the prompt, so retrieval and grounding behavior are unchanged.
- **2026-09-19** — Project-wide review pass, with fixes for every issue found. Real defects found and fixed:
  1. **`llm_client.py` crash on a spec-legal header.** `float(response.headers.get("retry-after", 5))` raised an uncaught `ValueError` when a provider returned `Retry-After` as an HTTP date (RFC 9110 permits either delta-seconds or a date). Replaced with `_retry_wait_seconds()`, which handles both forms; unit-tested across 9 cases (numeric, float, missing, garbage, negative, over-cap, and three HTTP-date variants).
  2. **`llm_client.py` unbounded sleep.** A large `Retry-After` would have blocked the app for as long as the provider asked. Waits are now capped at 30s; anything longer returns a readable error instead of hanging.
  3. **`llm_client.py` fragile/leaky response handling.** A non-JSON response raised an uncaught `ValueError`, and the malformed-response path dumped the entire API response body into the UI. Both replaced with a contained error carrying only the HTTP status.
  4. **Indirect prompt injection (security).** Retrieved document text was inserted into the prompt with no defense. Passages are now fenced in explicit delimiters and the system prompt declares them untrusted data. Verified with a purpose-built malicious PDF (an "ignore all previous instructions… reply PWNED" payload and a system-prompt-exfiltration payload): the model answered the legitimate question correctly, *reported* the injected instruction as document content rather than obeying it, and refused the exfiltration attempt.
  5. **Untrusted document text rendered as markdown.** The sources panel rendered passages via `st.markdown(f"> {text}")`, which both broke formatting on multi-line chunks (only the first line stayed quoted) and let document content inject markdown. Now rendered with `st.text`, which is literal.
  6. **Error state lost on rerun.** Assistant error messages were stored without their error flag, so an error shown in red re-rendered as ordinary text on the next rerun. The flag is now persisted and replayed; verified in-browser (two alert elements after a rerun, where the bug produced one).
  7. **`pdf_loader.py` resource leak.** The `Document` was closed only on the success path; an exception mid-extraction leaked the handle. Now opened with a context manager.
  8. **Unbounded inputs.** Uploads were capped at Streamlit's 200MB default while every upload is held in memory and embedded — a real risk on a small hosted instance. Capped at 25MB via `server.maxUploadSize`, and questions at 1000 characters.
  9. **`evaluate.py` fragility.** A single rate-limited question aborted an entire 12-call batch (observed twice). It now paces requests (`--delay`, default 8s) and records a per-question failure instead of discarding the run.
  10. **Unpinned dependencies / stale docs.** `requirements.txt` now carries tested lower bounds. `ARCHITECTURE.md` claimed the embedding model was cached with `st.cache_resource` — it never was (it uses a module-level singleton, deliberately, so the module works outside Streamlit); corrected. `README.md`'s usage steps still described the pre-chat UI and a "Document ready:" string that no longer exists; rewritten.
- **2026-09-19** — Re-ran the full two-configuration evaluation after the prompt hardening to confirm the documented findings weren't invalidated by the prompt change. Results are materially identical to the original run: config A still incorrectly refused 4 of 5 answerable questions and still produced the wrong BLEU figure (41.0 vs the document's 41.8), config B still answered all 5 correctly with accurate page citations, and the deliberately unanswerable question was still refused under both. The chunk-size finding and the default `chunk_size=800` choice therefore stand unchanged.
- **2026-09-19** — Autonomous maintenance pass: re-read every source file fresh (not from memory) looking for genuine defects. Found and fixed three real gaps, all tested:
  1. **Unhandled ingestion/query exceptions in `app.py`.** `pipeline.ingest()` and `pipeline.answer()` were only guarded against the specific failure modes each function is documented to raise (empty PDF, `LLMConfigError`, `LLMRequestError`). An unexpected failure — e.g. the embedding model failing to load from Hugging Face Hub on a cold start — was not caught, and would have crashed with Streamlit's raw exception UI instead of the graceful degradation the app promises elsewhere. Added a generic `except Exception` fallback on both paths that logs the real error to stderr and shows a clean message in the UI. Since a crash during ingestion and a genuinely bad PDF both leave `index_state is None`, added a `_ingest_crashed` session-state flag so the sidebar shows the *correct* message for each case rather than a misleading "couldn't extract text" for what was actually an unrelated crash.
  2. **`evaluate.py` had no top-level guard for a missing API key.** `LLMConfigError` was never caught, so running the script without `LLM_API_KEY` set crashed with an unhandled traceback on the very first question instead of a clear message — inconsistent with the graceful-error philosophy applied everywhere else in this project. Wrapped the config-A/config-B run in a `try/except LLMConfigError` that prints one clear line and exits 1. Verified: `LLM_API_KEY= python evaluate.py ...` now fails cleanly instead of crashing.
  3. **README's Installation section still had the literal placeholder** `git clone <this-repository-url>` from before the project had a public URL. Replaced with the real clone URL.
- **2026-09-19** — Added a real, committed `pytest` suite (`tests/` + root `conftest.py`), closing a gap this project's own `CONTRIBUTING.md` had explicitly flagged as missing. All prior verification in this log was done with ad-hoc scripts that lived only in a temp scratchpad and vanished at the end of the session — none of it was reproducible by anyone else, including a future me. The new suite covers `pdf_loader`, `chunker`, `embedder`, `vector_store`, `llm_client`, the full `pipeline`, and the prompt-injection resistance checks (promoted from the earlier one-off `injection_test.py` script into a permanent test). Tests that call a real LLM API are gated behind `LLM_API_KEY` with `pytest.mark.skipif` so the suite still runs meaningfully without credentials. Added `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to run the non-LLM-dependent subset on every push/PR to `main` — no secret needed, since the gated tests self-skip there too; this is deliberate, not a gap. Added `requirements-dev.txt` (`-r requirements.txt` + `pytest`) rather than adding pytest to the runtime `requirements.txt`, since it's a dev-only dependency. Added `.pytest_cache/`, `.ruff_cache/`, and `*.egg-info/` to `.gitignore` (the first was a real, immediate gap — running the new suite left an untracked `.pytest_cache/` directory).
  - Caught a real bug in the test suite itself while verifying it: the LLM-dependent tests initially all showed as SKIPPED even with a valid key in `.env`, because `conftest.py` never called `load_dotenv()` — `pytest` doesn't load `.env` automatically the way `app.py`/`evaluate.py` do. Fixed by loading `.env` in `conftest.py`, then re-ran and confirmed all 22 tests actually pass (16 always-on + 6 previously-unverified LLM-dependent ones) rather than trusting the SKIPPED result.
  - Updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`, which both explicitly said "no CI or automated test suite" — no longer true, and leaving that claim in place after adding real tests would have been exactly the kind of dishonest documentation this project has deliberately avoided throughout. Also updated README's "Unit-level testing" section to describe the real suite instead of implying one-off manual checks.
- **2026-09-19** — Replaced Streamlit with a FastAPI backend + a static HTML/CSS/JS frontend, mainly to fix Streamlit's poor mobile UX (sidebar-driven layouts and its widget chrome don't adapt well to narrow viewports, and there's no practical way to fully control that from application code) and to make the app feel like a real product rather than a data-app demo.
  - **Alternatives considered:**
    - *Stay on Streamlit, fight the mobile CSS harder.* Rejected — Streamlit doesn't expose enough layout control (no access to the outer shell, sidebar behavior is largely fixed) to get a genuinely good mobile chat experience; every workaround available would have meant fragile CSS-injection hacks, which contradicts this project's own established preference for not fighting frameworks.
    - *A full SPA framework (React/Vue/Svelte).* Rejected as overkill — this app is one page with modest client state (messages array, upload state); a framework would add a build step, `node_modules`, and a bundler for no real benefit at this scale, contradicting "avoid overengineering" and the project's consistent preference for the smallest architecture that does the job (see decision #1, no LangChain, for the same reasoning applied earlier to the backend).
    - *Flask instead of FastAPI.* Both are simple enough; FastAPI's request validation, native `UploadFile` handling for the PDF upload, and async support were a marginally better fit with no added complexity cost, so it won on a close call rather than Flask being wrong.
  - **What changed:** `app.py` (Streamlit UI) and `.streamlit/` (its config) deleted. Added `main.py` (FastAPI backend: `POST /api/ingest`, `POST /api/ask`, `POST /api/remove`, plus serving the frontend) and `static/index.html` + `static/style.css` + `static/app.js` (vanilla, no framework). `requirements.txt` swapped `streamlit` for `fastapi`, `uvicorn[standard]`, `python-multipart`. Added a `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` for deployment.
  - **What did not change:** `pdf_loader.py`, `chunker.py`, `embedder.py`, `vector_store.py`, `llm_client.py`, and `pipeline.py` are byte-identical in logic — `main.py` calls `pipeline.ingest()`/`pipeline.answer()` exactly as `app.py` did. `evaluate.py` and the `tests/` suite needed no changes at all for this reason; the only new test file is `tests/test_api.py`, which tests the new HTTP layer specifically.
  - **Session state:** since HTTP is stateless and the FAISS index has to persist across a document's questions, sessions are held in a plain in-memory `dict` on the server, keyed by a random token in an `httponly`, `samesite=lax` cookie set by `/api/ingest`, with a 2-hour inactivity TTL pruned opportunistically on each request. This is a deliberate simplicity tradeoff (see README "Known limitations") — a shared store (Redis) would be needed for multi-instance deployment, which this project doesn't need at its current scale. Serving the frontend from the same FastAPI app as the API means same-origin requests, so no CORS configuration was needed anywhere.
  - **Scope choice on configurability:** the old Streamlit UI exposed `chunk_size`/`chunk_overlap`/`top_k` as sidebar sliders. The new UI exposes none of these — a deliberate cut, not an oversight, since the task explicitly asked for a "VERY minimal" product-like UI with "no unnecessary clutter," and exposing internal RAG hyperparameters to end users is developer-demo behavior, not product behavior. `pipeline.ingest`/`pipeline.answer` still accept these as optional parameters, which is what `evaluate.py` uses for the two-configuration comparison — that capability was never in the UI's critical path.
  - **Real bugs caught and fixed during implementation, before considering this done:**
    1. A CSS specificity bug: `#chat-view { display: flex }` (an ID selector) unintentionally overrode the browser's own `[hidden] { display: none }` rule (lower specificity), which would have made the `hidden` attribute stop hiding that element. Fixed with an explicit `#chat-view[hidden] { display: none }` override.
    2. The chat input wasn't reliably pinned to the bottom of the viewport with few messages on screen — `position: sticky` only engages once content overflows its container, so a short conversation left the input floating right after the last message instead of anchored to the screen bottom. Rebuilt the layout as a proper flex "app shell" (fixed header, internally-scrolling message list, pinned input) instead of relying on sticky positioning; verified with `page.setViewportSize` at 375×667 that the input sits within 40px of the viewport bottom regardless of message count.
    3. `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` (added earlier, not part of this pass originally) called `streamlit run app.py` and forwarded port 8501 — both now stale/broken since `app.py` no longer exists. Updated to `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000` and port 8000, since leaving a contributor's Codespaces environment broken was a direct, foreseeable consequence of this migration, not an unrelated change.
  - **Testing performed:** full `pytest` suite (29 tests, including the new `test_api.py`) passing; the FastAPI server started and its endpoints (`/api/ingest`, `/api/ask`, `/api/remove`) exercised directly with `curl` first, then the actual frontend driven end-to-end in a real headless browser — upload, indexing, an answerable question with the correct grounded answer and page citation, sources disclosure, a follow-up question, a genuinely unanswerable question correctly refused, remove, and re-upload, all with zero browser console errors. Repeated at a 375×667 mobile viewport with screenshots actually reviewed (not just measured) to confirm no horizontal overflow and a usable layout.
- **2026-09-19** — Deployed to AWS EC2 (`t3.small`, `ap-south-1`, Free Tier eligible), after ruling out several platforms on real, verified constraints rather than assumption:
  - **Vercel**: authenticated access existed, but ruled out — serverless-only (no persistent-container product), and this app's in-memory per-session store needs exactly that; also its dependency footprint (~700MB+) doesn't fit serverless function size limits.
  - **Render**: genuinely free, no card — but empirically tested and disqualified. Running the actual built image with `docker run --memory=512m` (Render's free-tier cap) showed **509MiB/512MiB (99.4%) used at idle**, before even loading the embedding model. The first real request would have OOM-killed it.
  - **Fly.io / Railway**: researched current (2026) terms — neither has an ongoing free tier for new signups anymore (Fly requires a card after a 2-hour/7-day trial; Railway's $5 one-time credit runs out in days-to-weeks then requires a paid plan).
  - **Google Cloud Run**: has a real "Always Free" quota, but requires a card on file, and its default autoscaling has the same session-breaking problem as Vercel unless forced to `min-instances=1`, which falls outside the free quota.
  - **Oracle Cloud Always Free**: the best technical fit (real persistent VM, 12–24GB RAM) but requires a card on file, so not used without explicit sign-off.
  - **blitz.cloud**: genuinely free, no card, persistent container, GitHub-repo-to-Docker build — empirically re-tested by actually running the built image with `--memory=2g`, uploading a real 15-page PDF, and asking a real question through the full pipeline: **685MiB/2GiB (33%) peak, correct grounded answer**. A strong fit, but deployment there is web-dashboard-only (their own docs: "none of them involve a terminal") with no API/CLI, and account creation needs email verification neither of which this agent can complete unattended — session moved on to AWS at the user's direction before this was used.
  - **AWS EC2**: the user created the account and instance themselves (a genuine credential boundary this agent correctly stopped at rather than asking for AWS secret keys); handed off via SSH key + public IP for a single instance, not AWS account/IAM credentials, at the user's explicit request not to be asked for the latter.
  - **A real deployment-only bug found and fixed**: the first EC2 build pulled several hundred MB of NVIDIA CUDA packages (`nvidia-cudnn`, `nvidia-cublas`, `nvidia-nccl`, etc.) that PyPI's default Linux "torch" wheel bundles regardless of GPU presence — on the EC2 instance's small root volume this risked filling the disk mid-build. Fixed in the `Dockerfile` by installing torch from PyTorch's own CPU-only wheel index before the rest of `requirements.txt`, so `sentence-transformers` finds it already satisfied. Result: image content size dropped from ~3.3GB (the earlier Windows-built local image, which — worth noting for accuracy — likely already carried some of this bloat too, not independently confirmed either way) to **482MB**. This was caught by reading the live build log during deployment, not assumed to be fine.
  - **A self-inflicted mistake caught and fixed the same session**: after the first successful build, `docker system prune -af` was run to reclaim disk space — `-a` removes *all* unused images, not just build cache, and since the newly-built image wasn't yet referenced by a running container it was deleted along with the cache. Caught immediately via `docker images` showing nothing, rebuilt (fast, ~76s, no re-download of the now-cached-nothing since `--no-cache-dir` means every build re-fetches packages — network was simply fast), and the container was started *immediately* after the second build specifically to avoid repeating the mistake.
  - **Final verified state**: container running with `--restart unless-stopped` (survives reboot), Nginx reverse-proxying port 80 → `127.0.0.1:8000` with `client_max_body_size 25m` (matching the app's own upload cap) and 120s proxy timeouts (for LLM call latency), full E2E flow (upload → grounded answer with citation → sources → follow-up → correct refusal → remove → re-upload) verified via a real headless browser against the live public URL, zero console errors. `.env` transferred via `scp` directly to the instance, never committed, never logged.
  - **One item genuinely left open**: SSH access to the instance stopped working partway through final verification (three consecutive "Connection timed out" — a network-level drop, not an auth failure) immediately after the user edited the instance's security group to add the HTTP rule; the HTTP/public-app access itself was and remains unaffected and fully verified. Live memory-usage confirmation was therefore taken from the identical local test (685MiB/2GiB under the same real-document-plus-LLM-call load) rather than a live SSH-obtained number for this specific instance — reported as such, not conflated with a live reading. Flagged to the user to check whether the security group edit altered the SSH rule; not something this agent can fix without console access.
